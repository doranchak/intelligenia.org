Recovery</strong></font></p>

2001 Enigma M2946 and parts of Enigma M3131 were recovered from U-85 together with a
printing device - a modified typewriter - which appears to have been connected to M2946.
This feat was accomplished by divers Jim Bunch and brothers Rich and Roger Hunting - all
three of whom have been diving on the wreck of U-85 for a number of years. Also recovered
were a number of pages of a codebook used for flag signal communications with merchant
vessels and a pad used for preparing radio messages for transmission. </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="4"><br>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&quot;We found the Enigma on July 3, 2001. We
began running an air-lift dredge operation inside the U-85 during the summer of 2000. This
past summer we concentrated our efforts in the Radio Room [<font color="#FF0000">A</font>]
and the Sound [sonar] Room&nbsp; [<font color="#FF0000">B</font>]. In June we spent a week
emptying out the Sound Room (we did that first since it was easier to reach). It took
three divers about six days to pump out the Sound Room at 2-3 dives each per day, 30-35
minutes per dive (about 20 hours of continuous dredging). We found lots of little
artifacts in the Sound Room, probably the most significant was a large brass compass, a
wooden box of phonograph records and the stack of Enigma log sheets. We then moved to the
Radio Room, which was considerably more difficult to dredge because of its location and
the volume of debris to be removed. On the third day of dredging, we uncovered the Enigma
[M2946] laying on the floor about in the center of the room. The wooden lid was not on the
box when we found it. We found the printer contraption on the same day, about in the same
location. Two days later, we found the lid of the box and the wheels for what appears to
be the second machine [M3131]. We spent another week or so cleaning out the Radio Room and
found a couple of coffee cups, a Perrier water bottle, a flashlight, two ceramic
insulators used on the external radio antenna and other miscellaneous junk. </font></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><em>If you are familiar with the configuration of
the interior of a Type VII U-boat, you know that the captain's quarters [<font color="#FF0000">C</font>] were on the port side just across the aisle from the Radio Room.
Since the U-85 is sitting in the bottom with about a 30 degree heel to starboard, all the
lockers in the captain's quarters have broken loose and fallen into the debris in the
aisle. A lot of this is still buried under mud and sand, and it is an area of future
opportunity.&quot;</em><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>A year later - on 22 August 2002&nbsp; -
the rest of Enigma M3131 was recovered. Again - as described by diver Roger Hunting:</strong></font></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">&quot;The
second Enigma was located in the Radio Room, just like M2946.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">As
you recall, we had recovered the rotors and wooden lid of M3131 shortly after recovering
M2946 on July 3, 2001, but the rest of the machine was not found during the summer of
2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>At that time we were using a 4&quot; diameter
dredge and we had removed about as much as we could out of the Radio Room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The only remaining mud was at the very low side of
the room, remembering that the submarine has a 40 degree list to starboard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We had reached a cabinet along the hull and assumed that
the cabinet went all the way to the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was
difficult getting down in that portion of the room since you almost had to be standing on
you head to reach the far corner.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">It
is interesting that on the outside of the submarine the sand bottom registers 100 feet,
yet when we were at the low side of the Radio Room we were reaching 107 feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition to being difficult to reach, the low
pocket in the Radio Room contained lots of debris (remains of cabinetry, electrical parts,
wiring, etc.) that kept plugging up the 4&quot; dredge pipe.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So
we left the last remaining mud and gave up on finding the second Enigma.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We
moved our dredge pipe from the Radio Room to the Galley area toward the end of the summer
of 2001 and recovered several pieces of silverware and a few coffee cups and saucers.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">At
the beginning of the 2002 dive season we increased the dredge pipe diameter to 6&quot; and
were able to handle much larger pieces of debris without plugging.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We
did more dredging in the Galley and then moved to the Forward Torpedo Room.</span></font></em></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We
felt fairly certain that the M3131 was still in the last remaining pile of mud in the
Radio Room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In July we moved our dredge back
to the Radio Room for one last shot at the remaining mud.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The
6&quot; pipe worked well and in no time, we discovered that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>what we thought was a cabinet was a counter top.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> D</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">own
under that counter, at the very lowest part of the room, was the second machine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It took only three dives to finish the job that we
gave up on the previous summer&quot;.</span></font></em></p>
