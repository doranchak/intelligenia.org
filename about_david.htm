<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>David Hamer was 
born in the United Kingdom and educated there and in the United States as a 
physical chemist but he spent the greater part of his career away from the 
sciences. His interests were broadly mathematical and included classical 
cryptology - the study of codes and ciphers -particularly the German Enigma 
and other WW2 cipher systems. He was a keen, amateur astronomer and was, in 
addition, totally addicted to the Times (London) and Guardian crossword 
puzzles. He lectured extensively on the technological history of cryptology, 
is the author of a number of articles on Enigma and other cipher machines and 
made television appearances - most recently on the USA's Fox News Channel, 
BBC's Newsnight and on the National Geographic channel broadcast in both the 
UK and USA.</strong></font></p> 


<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>David was 
associated with the National Security Agency's [NSA] National Cryptologic 
Museum [NCM] in Fort Meade, MD as a member of the Executive Committee of the 
NCM Foundation, Vice-Chairman of the Acquisitions Committee and the 
Foundation's UK Liaison Officer. In 2013 he was presented with NSA's 
Commemorative Service Medal by that agency's Deputy Director, Mr. John C. 
'Chris' Inglis. David was also an active member of the Crypto Simulation Group, 
a member of the Editorial Board of the academic journal Cryptologia<i> </i>and 
an Associate Editor of the UK-published Eye Spy magazine. In 2000 David was 
appointed Visiting Research Scholar by the Bletchley Park Trust, custodians of 
the cryptologic museum at Bletchley Park in the UK: in 2007 he was awarded the 
Freedom of Bletchley Park. Since 2002 he has been part of the organizing team 
for the 'Conflict' series of historical conferences held annually at Christ 
Church, Oxford. In 2014 he was selected to represent the UK's National Museum 
of Computing [TNMoC] at an international cryptologic conference in the United 
States and most recently was invited to serve on the Board of Directors of 
Robarts Ltd., a multi-faceted London-based company whose broad area of 
interests includes modern developments in intelligence 
gathering. David served as the historian for EnigmaMuseum.com starting in 2005.

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>Various career 
moves and appointments have resulted in a rather nomadic lifestyle. David made 
his home in the United States since the mid-1960's. Several long-term 
assignments have resulted in&nbsp; periods of residence in Berlin, Paris and 
London. His travels have also taken him to India, Malta, Nigeria, North Africa 
and the Middle-East, and most of the countries of western Europe. He saw 
military service with the Royal Air Force in an intelligence 
role.</strong></font></p> 

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>David's wife 
Joan, also a native of the UK, is retired from her position as an 
officer with a major U.S. bank.</strong></font></p>
