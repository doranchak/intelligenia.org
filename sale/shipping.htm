<p align="center"><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Shipping note:</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Normally, all costs of packaging and shipping will
be the responsibility of the purchaser and will be quoted at the time of the initial
order. Unless otherwise requested all items such as books, manuals, etc. for destinations
within the US and Canada will be sent via USPS Priority Mail [or USPS First Class Mail if
appropriate] which <font color="#FF0000"><u>carries no insurance cover of the contents</u></font>.
If insurance is required this must be specified at the time of the initial order and the
cost will be included in the shipping charges to be borne by the purchaser. For shipment
to other destinations the cost will be quoted on an individual basis. While every care
will be taken to ensure safe delivery of purchased items the responsibilty for the
insurance of contents is that of the purchaser.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Larger items [cipher machines, etc.] will be
shipped via a carrier such as UPS, FedEx, etc. - and full insurance of the contents will
be included in any quoted shipping charges.</font></strong></p>
