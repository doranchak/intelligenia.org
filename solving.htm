crosswords<br>
</strong>[from the pages of The Guardian]</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">The Golden Rule for setting a good cryptic clue was
laid down by Ximenes of the Observer, the late DS McNutt (1902-71): &quot;I may not mean
what I say, but I must say what I mean.&quot;</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">A cryptic clue is trying to lead you off in the
wrong direction. You&nbsp; need to deconstruct the clue and concentrate on the separate
parts. Don't get sidetracked by punctuation and the use of capital letters - they are
designed to mislead you. To help you, every fair clue will contain a 'definition' of the
answer (usually at the beginning or the end), or the whole clue will be the definition.
Here are the main types of trick used - often more than one will appear in any given clue.
</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><strong>Double meanings:</strong> The clue can be split in
two with both parts leading to the same word.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Example 1: Savings book (7) = RESERVE - your
savings are a reserve and you can book/reserve, say, a ticket<br>
Example 2: Frequently decimal? (5) = OFTEN - the decimal system counts in units OF TEN </font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><strong>S = A + B or A + B = S:</strong> With the
solution(s) defined at the beginning or at the end, the rest of the clue provides building
blocks to find it.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Example 1: Express belief in old deal (5) = OPINE -
to express a belief is to opine = O (old) + PINE (deal wood)<br>
Example 2: Drink ale with fan (9) = SUPPORTER - a fan is a supporter = SUP (drink) +
PORTER (ale) </font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><strong>Anagrams:</strong> The definition should still be
at the beginning or the end of the clue, but a disguised anagram indicator will tell you
that the answer is to be found by rearranging the letters of other words contained in it.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Example 1: It rarely turns out like this in books
(8) = LITERARY- literary means 'in books'; and 'turns out like this' indicates an anagram
of 'it rarely'<br>
Example 2: Tube taken to theatre for three-act play (8) = CATHETER- a catheter is a tube
used in an operating theatre and 'play' indicates an ANAGRAM of THREE-ACT </font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><strong>Hidden clues:</strong> The clue contains an
indicator that the answer to the definition is hidden somewhere in the other words; if so
indicated, it may be hidden backwards.<br>
<br>
Example 1: Scientist finding partial evidence in Steinbeck (8) = EINSTEIN- the scientist,
is to be found in part of 'evidenc[E IN STEIN]beck' <br>
Example 2: From novel crick in the neck get backing all round (6) = CIRCLE - circle is
round and is got backwards from 'nov[EL CRIC]k in the neck' </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><strong>Split words:</strong> To get the answer that fits
the definition, one part of the solution goes inside (or outside) the other, with an
indicator to alert you.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="4">Example 1: Decay in vegetable or shrub (6) = PROTEA
- a shrub produced by ROT (decay) going in PEA (vegetable) as P[ROT]EA<br>
Example 2: Casablanca star grabs love for a dance (6) = BOOGIE - Bogie (H. Bogart) takes
in (grabs) 0 (love) to produce a dance = BO[O]GIE </font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><strong>Homophones:</strong> Words or syllables that sound
like each other but are spelled differently.<br>
Example 1: Pirate with a rough sounding manner (7) = CORSAIR - a pirate who sounds like
coarse (rough) air (manner)<br>
Example 2: Husky makes noise like a bigger animal (5) = HORSE - an animal bigger than a
dog that sounds like hoarse </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><strong>Pure cryptics:</strong> The occasional clue
(usually aimed at producing a chuckle) where the definition and the whole clue are the
same thing.<br>
<br>
Famous examples: Bar of soap (3,6,6) = THE ROVERS RETURN - the pub in the soap, Coronation
Street <br>
H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O (5) = WATER - H to O sounds like H20, the atomic composition of water <br>
Amundsen's forwarding address (4) = MUSH - what the Norwegian who got to the South Pole
first said to his dog teams to make them move </font></p>
